GOST comprises 16 BibTeX styles to format bibliography in English, Russian 
and Ukrainian according to GOST 7.0.5-2008 and GOST 7.1-2003. Both 8-bit 
and Unicode (UTF-8) versions of each BibTeX style, in each case offering 
a choice of sorted and unsorted. Further, 2 more styles, |gost780| and 
|gost780s| styles (not conforming to effective standards) are retained 
for backwards compatibility.

All BibTeX styles are derived from same master file |gost.dtx| by applying 
different set of options as shown in the table below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Gost2008| style is recommended for most applications. It corresponds to the
currently effective Standard 7.0.5-2008. Librarians should use the style
|gost2003| instead of |gost2008| to compile a library catalog to meet the
Standard 7.1-2003. Use of other styles is best explained through
the meaning of options used to compile those styles from the master source.

Two styles, |gost780| and |gost780s|, generated without |modern| and 
|strict| options, are retained for backward compatibility. They do not 
conform the Standards 7.0.5-2008 and 7.1-2003 cited above.

The |strict| option provides conformance to the Standard 7.1-2003. The
styles compiled with that option bear the name |gost2003| with possible
suffixes |s|, |l|, |n| as explained below. These styles are intended 
primarily for the librarians who compose a library catalog.

The |modern| option meets the Standard 7.0.5-2008 which can be thought
off as a relaxed version of the Standard 7.1-2003. The styles compiled with
that option bear the name |gost2008| with possible suffixes |s|, |l|, |n|.
The |strict| option  has precedence over |modern| so that a style compiled
with both options will resemble mainly the |gost2003| style rather than 
|gost2008|.

If the number of authors exceeds 4, modern styles cut the list of authors
to at most 4 persons as prescibed by the Standards. The option
|long| overrides this rule to provide backward compatibility with the
package disser by Stanislab Kruchinin. Two styles, |gost2008l| and
|gost2008ls|, compiled with the option |long| mimic behavior of the styles
|gost705| and |gost705s| from the disser package. Major
effect of the |long| option is that the list of authors always
precedes book or article title no matter how long is it.
Modern styles compiled without |long| place long list of authors behind
the title. The names of styles compiled with the option |long| has the
suffix |l|. Recall that those styles do not conform effective Standards and
their use is discouraged. 

The |eprint| option enables formatting electronic publications. In particular,
it enables |eprint|, |eprinttype|, |eprintclass|, and |doi| fields for a
bibliographic entry. The styles, generated without the |eprint| option,
just ignore the these fields. Starting from the
version 1.2 of the GOST package, all modern styles are compiled with this
option included, and therefore the suffix |e| which designated
this option in earlier  versions is not appended to the name of style
any more.

The |natbib| option provides compatibility with the |natbib| package. The names 
of styles compiled with the option |natbib| bear the suffix |n|. Currently
4 styles with that option are available for public use.

The |sort| option enables sorting bibliographic references by author names
and titles of references. The names of styles compiled with the option |sort|
bear the suffix |s|. Sorting does not work as expected for databases in
unicode encoding (see below). 

Finally, the |utf8| option produces bibliographic styles in unicode rather
that in 8-bit encoding. Names of those styles bear the prefix |u|.


Beyond bibliographic style, GOST bundle contains CS files (codepage and
sorting order).

----------------------------------------------------------------
 Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order
----------------------------------------------------------------
 cp866           |   ruscii.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
 cp1251          |   cp1251.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
 koi8-u          |   koi8u.csf           Cyrillic first, Latin
 utf8            |   utf8cyrillic.csf    Cyrillic first, Latin
----------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, BibTeX8 distribution comes with few more CSFs.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order
----------------------------------------------------------------
 cp866           |   cp866rus.csf        Latin first, Cyrillic
----------------------------------------------------------------


How to use

1. Select bibliography style by adding appropriate \bibliographystyle
   declaration to your source file <filename>.tex, e.g.

	\bibliographystyle{gost2008}
	\bibliography{database}

2. Add the field language="ukrainian" or language="russian" to the
   bibliographic entries in Ukrainian or Russian languages in your
   database; English is the default language. German, Italian and
   French are also supported.

3. To compile list of references from your database use bibtex8.exe
   rather than bibtex.exe. Depending on the codepage of your
   bibliographic database, indicate one of the CS files
   listed above as option to bibtex8.exe.  Run LaTeX, then run
   bibTeX8 and again LaTeX:

   	latex <filename>.tex
   	bibtex8 -B -c <csf_file>.csf <filename>.aux
	latex <filename>.tex

4. For details on preparing bibliographic database see
   examples in |gost*.pdf|.

5. Ugost*.bst styles are primarily intended for use
   with unicode compilers (xelatex and lualatex). They
   should be preferred as well when using 8bit compilers
   (latex and pdflatex) if source file is in utf8 encoding.

6. Neither bitex.exe nor bitex8.exe provides
   correct sorting order of unicode text. It means that using
   ugost2008s or any other style ended with `s' in
   its name may produce unexpected result for utf8 documents.

7. Bibtex8 fails to change case of a string if it contains Cyrillic
   letter in unicode. Therefore ugost2008* styles do not change case of
   titles and other parts of bibliographic record while 8-bit styles
   do the case change where appropriate.

8. Either |bibtex8| or |Bibtex8| fail to cut Cyrillic names to
   initials. Therefore |ugost2008*| styles do not modify the name of
   authors.

9. Package |natbib| should be loaded when using styles with
   suffix |n| in their names. 


Customization

Every GOST style defines few commands to format some parts of a
reference. You can redefine these commands prior to
the \bibliography{<bibtex_style>} command. Initial
definitions are listed below.

	\providecommand*{\url}[1]{{\small #1}}
	\providecommand*{\BibUrl}[1]{\url{#1}}
	\providecommand{\BibAnnote}[1]{}
	\providecommand*{\BibEmph}[1]{#1}

By default, gost styles separate logical parts of a bibliography
record by a period and cyrdash (. "---). It is legitimate to drop
that dash by overriding the command \BibDash as follows

	\providecommand*{\BibDash}{}

By default, \BibDash is equivalent to the shorthand "---
introduced by the babel package with the option russian.
It prints a so called Cyrillic dash (\cyrdash), which is
20% shorter than ordinary LaTeX dash (---), and puts
unbreakable space before \cyrdash so that the dash never 
appears at the beginning of a line.
